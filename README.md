# Natalie's Photo App

Welcome to the repo for Natalie's Photos!

This app is still heavily in development, but it is a complex platform that handles the storing, selling, and licensing of Natalie's photos.
I am using some new technologies like TRPC, Next.js, and NextAuth in this project as they are best for these smaller applications that need to scale fast.

# Goals

The goals for this project are as follows:

- [x] Create authentication using NextAuth & Google
- [x] Integrate S3 as a photo storage solution
- [x] Integrate stripe in order to sell the photos
- [x] Create a service which can automatically watermark photos
- [x] Create a quick and easy way for distribution of the photos
